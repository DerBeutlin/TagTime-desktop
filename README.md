This is a cross-platform desktop GUI implementation of [TagTime](https://github.com/dreeves/TagTime).

To determine how you spend your time, TagTime literally randomly samples you. At random times it pops up and asks what you're doing right at that moment. You answer with tags.

See http://messymatters.com/tagtime for the whole story.

Inspired by [alice0meta](https://github.com/alice0meta/TagTime).

# Installation and Quick Start

# Contributing

Contributions welcome! This is a fun side-project, and your use-case might be different to mine.
Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for design and development info.

## Beeminder

I don't use [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com), so haven't implemented support. Pull requests welcome.
