# TagTime-desktop
[![Linux & macOS Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mykter/TagTime-desktop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mykter/TagTime-desktop)

This is a cross-platform desktop GUI re-implementation of [TagTime](https://github.com/dreeves/TagTime).

To determine how you spend your time, TagTime literally randomly samples you. At random times it pops up and asks what you're doing right at that moment. You answer with tags.

See messymatters.com/tagtime for the whole story.
