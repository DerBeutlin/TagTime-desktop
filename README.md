This is a cross-platform desktop GUI implementation of [TagTime](https://github.com/dreeves/TagTime).

To determine how you spend your time, TagTime literally randomly samples you. At random times it pops up and asks what you're doing right at that moment. You answer with tags.

See http://messymatters.com/tagtime for the whole story.

Here's a clip of an intrepid user getting pinged by TagTime whilst job hunting. As well as what "project" they're working on, they're also using TagTime to record what tools they're using - in this case, emails. Later, they'll be able to analyze their tags to see how they spend their time on the computer.

## Beeminder

I don't use [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com), so haven't implemented support. Pull requests welcome.
